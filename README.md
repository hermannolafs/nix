It's a nixed up world (World) and a nixed up place (Place)
Everybody's judged by their nixed up flake
Fucked up dreams (Dreams), nixed up life (Life)
A nixed up kid with a nixed up knife
Nixed up moms (Moms) and nixed up dads (Dads)
It's a nixed up cop with a nixed up badge
Nixed up job (Job) with nixed up pay
And a nixed up boss, this a nixed up day
Nixed up press (Press) with nixed up lies (Lies)
While Lethal's in the back with the nixed up server
